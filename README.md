Handwritten digit classification is a useful method which can benefit many fields, such as document classification, automated letter processing, etc. We used the dataset by Duin and Tax and applied data preprocessing such as normalization. We then trained a neural model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) to their corresponding value. We utilized methods such as hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. We then compared our model to a linear classifier. The obtained results exceeded expectations, with a reported accuracy of 97.6%. Overall, the project provided crucial baseline knowledge on practical implementations of multilayer perceptrons.
